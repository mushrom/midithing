midithing
---------

A basic midi synthesizer which has a cool gameboy-ish sound.
Currently only supports playback on linux.

#### Demos
 - ![Pokemon mystery dungeon, sky tower](/../examples/files/Pokemon%20Mystery%20Dungeon%20-%20Sky%20Tower.ogg?raw=true)
- ![Pokemon trainer battle](/../examples/files/Pokemon%20Trainer%20Battle.ogg?raw=true)
- ![Zelda the minish cap, town](/../examples/files/Zelda%20Minish%20Cap%20Town.ogg?raw=true)


#### Features

- Plays most SMF (.mid) files
- Synth with a few different instruments and drums
- .wav output
- Looping


#### Coming soon

- teensy-based sequencer/synth hybrid based on this
- audio support for windows
- probably a GUI
- maybe some tools for manipulating midi files
